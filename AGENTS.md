# Context Engineering Protocol

[enso – a context management structure for agentic coding](https://github.com/usefulmove/enso)

enso v0.2.0

A single-file seed for managing context across LLM agents, sessions, and tools.

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how to manage context when working with LLM agents on software projects. The workflow:

1. Drop this file into a project directory
2. Point an agent to it
3. Agent bootstraps the directory structure
4. Agent creates a PRD from conversation with human
5. Documents evolve as work unfolds, staying compact and focused

The goal: maintain the smallest set of high-signal tokens needed for the next step.

## 2. The Six Operations

**Context is finite.** The context window is the agent's working memory. Every token competes for attention. Treat context as a scarce resource.

| Operation | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Write** | Persist information outside the context window | Working memory is temporary; persistence survives sessions |
| **Select** | Load only what's needed right now | Don't waste tokens on irrelevant context |
| **Probe** | Actively search (grep, LSP, glob) for answers | Don't assume you know what's in the codebase |
| **Compress** | Summarize to fit the token budget | When context gets full, condense instead of dropping |
| **Isolate** | Split work across multiple scopes | Divide complex tasks to stay within limits |
| **Assign** | Choose the ideal agent for each task | Match task requirements to agent capabilities |

**Keep current, not historical.** Documents reflect the present state. Git preserves history. Don't accumulate cruft in docs.

**Progressive disclosure.** Load context only when needed. Frontmatter before full docs. Summaries before details.

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Working Context** | Active tokens in the current LLM call. Ephemeral, limited by context budget. |
| **Persistent Context** | Markdown documents that survive across sessions. Includes Core, Stories, Reference, Skills, and Logs. |
| **Reference Context** | Queryable external sources: codebase (LSP, grep), RAG indexes, web. Not stored in the doc system. |
| **Compaction** | Summarizing working context into persistent context before it's lost. |
| **Context Budget** | The token limit of the model's context window. |
| **Context Scope** | Per-story declaration of file boundaries: what the agent can write, read, or must exclude. |

**Hierarchy:**

```
WORKING CONTEXT (ephemeral, token-limited)
    |
    | <- Select (load)     -> Write (persist)
    v                         v
PERSISTENT CONTEXT (markdown, durable)
  |-- Core Docs (PRD, Architecture, Standards)
  |-- Stories (active tasks)
  |-- Reference (conventions, completed work)
  |-- Skills (on-demand capabilities)
  |-- Logs (session summaries)

REFERENCE CONTEXT (external, queryable)
  |-- Codebase (LSP, grep, git)
  |-- RAG indexes
  |-- External sources (web, APIs)
```

## 4. Directory Structure

```text
docs/
  core/           # Source of Truth (PRD, Architecture)
  stories/        # Active Units of Work (The "Ticket" system)
  reference/      # Long-term Memory (Lessons, Conventions)
  skills/         # Local Capabilities (Scripts, Tests)
  logs/           # Session History
```

## 5. Bootstrapping

When an agent encounters this file in a new project:

1. **Create structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/{core,stories,reference/completed,skills,logs}
   touch docs/reference/LESSONS.md
   ```

2. **Add retrieval-led reasoning instruction** to root `AGENTS.md`:
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning 
   for framework-specific and domain-specific tasks.
   ```

3. **Gather context** — Prompt the human for the problem, success criteria, scope, and constraints.

4. **Generate PRD** — Create `docs/core/PRD.md` from the conversation.

5. **System Mapping** — Probe the codebase to create `ARCHITECTURE.md`, identify capabilities, and document conventions.

6. **First story** — Create the initial story in `docs/stories/`.

7. **Begin work**

## 6. Document Lifecycle

Context is living code. Refactor documentation as aggressively as you refactor code. Stale context is technical debt.

**Core Docs** (PRD, Architecture, Standards) — Update in place when scope changes. Don't preserve history—git does.

**Stories** — Create when planning, update during execution, move to `reference/completed/` when done.

**Reference** — Conventions and lessons. Read-only during execution; prune when irrelevant. **Update `LESSONS.md` with new learnings.**

**Skills** — Add as needed, update when procedures change, remove when obsolete.

**Logs** — Append session summaries after compaction; prune when no longer informative.

## 7. Context Scope

Every story declares its context boundaries:

```markdown
## Context Scope

**Write** (files this task will modify):
- src/auth/login.ts
- src/auth/session.ts

**Read** (files for reference only):
- docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md
- src/auth/types.ts

**Exclude** (ignore these):
- src/legacy/
- *.test.ts
```

**Enforcement:**
- Agent must not modify files outside Write scope
- Read files are a seed; use Probe to dynamically discover related context
- Agent should consult Read files before making changes
- Agent should avoid loading Excluded paths into context
- Scope changes require explicit human approval

## 8. Skills

On-demand capabilities for **vertical, action-specific workflows** (migrations, upgrades, transformations).

**When to use:**
- **Skills**: One-time actions (migrate, upgrade, refactor)
- **AGENTS.md + docs/core/**: Always-available knowledge

**Location:** `docs/skills/<skill-name>/`

**Structure:**
```
SKILL.md      # Required: frontmatter + when to use
scripts/      # Optional: executable code
references/   # Optional: additional docs
assets/       # Optional: templates, data files
```

**Discovery:** Agent scans directories at session start, reads frontmatter (~100 tokens) for discovery, loads full skill only when needed.

## 8.1. Framework Documentation Index

Store version-matched framework docs in `docs/core/framework/` and add an index to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Framework Documentation
Location: docs/core/framework/

| Section | Files |
|---------|-------|
| Routing | routing.md, navigation.md |
| Caching | cache-directives.md, cache-lifecycle.md |
```

**Why this works:** Always present, standard Markdown, retrieval-led (100% accuracy vs. 79% with on-demand skills).

## 9. Compaction

Moves insights from working context to persistent context.

**Triggers:** ~80% token utilization, completing a story, circular conversation, ending session.

**Process:** Summarize decisions, list artifacts, extract lessons to `LESSONS.md`, write summary to `logs/`, continue with fresh context.

## 10. Templates

Templates are guidelines, not rigid forms. Start minimal, expand as needed.

### PRD

```markdown
# [Project] PRD

## Problem
What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?

## Goals
What does success look like?

## Scope
**In scope:** ...
**Out of scope:** ...
```

### Architecture

```markdown
# [Project] Architecture

## Overview
High-level description.

## Components
| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| ... | ... |
```

### Story

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ...

## Context Scope
**Write:** ...
**Read:** ...
**Exclude:** ...

## Approach & Verification Plan
How to verify success (tests, manual steps).
```

### Session Summary

```markdown
# Session: [Topic]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview
What was accomplished.

## Key Decisions

```

## 11. Agent Guidelines

- **Search first.** Exhaust search tools before asking for paths.
- **Tool Selection.** Skills for vertical workflows, framework docs for APIs, external tools for navigation.
- **Prefer retrieval over training.** Consult `docs/` for framework specifics.
- **Read before writing.** Check Context Scope and Read files.
- **Update, don't accumulate.** Modify docs in place—git tracks history.
- **Compact proactively.** Don't wait for context overflow.
- **Stay in scope.** Don't modify files outside Write scope without approval.
- **Be concise.** Terse, technical communication.
